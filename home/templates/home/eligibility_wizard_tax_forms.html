<h1>Outreachy Eligibility Checking</h1>

{% include "home/snippet/privacy_policy.html" %}
<p>
In order to be paid, each Outreachy intern will need to fill out one of two tax forms: a W-9 or a W8-BEN.
Interns who are living outside the United States of America may be eligible to fill out a W8-BEN.
These questions will help us determine which form you will need to fill out.
</p>
<p>
Please note that Outreachy organizers have experience working with people who are in the middle of name changes or who people who wish to use a pseudonym.
The tax forms with your legal name will not be shared with mentors.
</p>
<p>
We need to know whether you will be residing in the United States of America during the Outreachy internship period,
and five weeks after the internship period ends.
That period is from {{ current_round.internstarts|date:"F d, Y" }} to {{ current_round.sfc_payment_last_date|date:"F d, Y" }}.
