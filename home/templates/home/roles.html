<ul>
	<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> During the application process, Outreachy applicants make contributions to FOSS projects and apply to be an Outreachy intern.</li>
	<li><strong>Intern:</strong> An accepted applicant works with a mentor for three months during the internship period.</li>
	<li><strong>Mentor:</strong> A mentor defines a project, and works with applicants to help them complete contributions to the project during the application process. The mentor works one-on-one with the selected intern during the internship process. An intern can have one or more mentors, but always has one main mentor that tracks their progress. <a href="/mentor/#mentor">Please read the mentor duties.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Volunteer:</strong> During the application process, volunteers help applicants find the right mentor, answer questions, and help applicants when they get stuck trying to make a contribution. <a href="/mentor/#volunteer">Please read the volunteer duties.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Coordinator:</strong> Each internship project must be associated with a FOSS community participating in Outreachy. That community provides funding for interns, either directly from community funds, or by finding a company or foundation to sponsor interns. Each community has one or more coordinators, who review submitted projects, approve mentors, and generally provide a communication link between the mentors and Outreachy organizers. Some smaller communities have only one coordinator, who is also the only mentor. <a href="/mentor/#coordinator">Please read the coordinator duties.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Outreachy organizers:</strong> There is <a href="/contact/">a small set of organizers</a> who oversee the entire Outreachy program. They communicate with coordinators about funding, onboard new communities, collect payment information for interns, coordinate mid-term and final reviews, answer questions, and promote the program to universities, bootcamps, and tech groups.</li>
