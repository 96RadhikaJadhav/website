			<p>The Outreachy organizers are reviewing your school
			time commitments. We need your help to provide more
			information about your school terms and academic
			calendar.</p>
			
			<p>Applicants need to have 49 consecutive days free from full-time
			commitments. Due to the time commitment, students in
			the northern hemisphere will most likely be eligible
			for the May to August internship round. Students from
			the southern hemisphere will most likely be eligible
			for the December to March internships.</p>

			<p>We have observed that some students make the following common mistakes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>forget to include all terms during the internship period from
			{{ current_round.internstarts|date:"F d, Y" }} to
			{{ current_round.internends|date:"F d, Y" }}.</li>
				<li>list term dates that differ from their official academic calendar</li>
				<li>state that they will be receiving school course credit for their Outreachy internship for more than one term</li>
				<li>list graduate credits when they are not graduate students</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			Please ensure your school terms are correct by providing updated information below.

			<p><b>Please ensure you have listed all terms</b>.
			You need to list all terms that overlap with

			{{ current_round.internends|date:"F d, Y" }}.</p>

			<p><b>Please ensure that the term start and end dates
			match the dates on your academic calendar</b>. We cannot
			make exceptions for starting clases late. Your
			application will be rejected if the term start date
			does not match your academic calendar's date for the
			start of classes. Your application will be rejected if
			your term end date does not match the academic calendar
			date for when exams end for all students in your
			school term.</p>

			<p>If your academic calendar for your next term has not
			been released yet, please use the academic calendar
			for the term during the previous school year.</p>

			<p><b>Please provide proof that students are allowed to
			enroll in a part-time course load.</b> In many
			schools, especially in India, it is required
			(compulsory) that students register for a specific
			number of credits each term.  We cannot accept letters
			from school administrators providing an exception to
			these policies.  Please provide a link to a page on
			your official school's website that shows students can
			register for a part-time course load without an
			exception.</p>
