<h1>Email Subscriptions</h1>

<p>
Unfortunately, because Outreachy is running Mailman 2.0, we can't automatically
subscribe coordinators and mentors to the mailing lists with Django.
It's a manual process to subscribe approved mentors and approved coordinators
for communities that are approved to participate in a round.
</p>

<p>
Outreachy organizers can see the <a href="{% url 'trusted-volunteers-list' %}">full list of email addresses</a>
for all approved community coordinators and mentors with approved projects.
Then subscribe them using the following links (anyone already subscribed won't be subscribed again):
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://lists.outreachy.org/cgi-bin/mailman/admin/mentors/members/add">mentors mailing list</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://lists.outreachy.org/cgi-bin/mailman/admin/announce/members/add">announce mailing list</a></li>
</ul>
