<p>You'll need to send a reminder email to mentors who have an approved project to let them know about the application deadline, and to give them instructions on how to help applicants complete the timeline:
<ul>
	<li>About a week before the late deadline, but after the regular application deadline. Send the email on {{ due }} after 4pm UTC.</li>
</ul>
</p>
