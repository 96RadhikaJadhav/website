Outreachy internship deadlines

{{ current_round.appslate }} is the deadline for making contributions and submitting your final application for the {{ current_round.official_name }}. If you haven't started a contribution yet, now is the time to pick a project, get in contact with the project mentor, and start working with them on your project contribution:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'project-selection' %}
{% if late_projects %}
There {{ late_projects|pluralize:"is,are" }} {{ late_projects|length }} project{{ late_projects|pluralize }} where few people have applied. The deadline to apply to {{ late_projects|pluralize:"that project,those projects" }} has been extended to {{ current_round.appslate }}:
{% endif %}{% for project in late_projects %}{% if forloop.first %}
{% endif %}{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{{ project.get_landing_url }}
{% endfor %}{% if promoted_projects %}
{{ promoted_projects|length }} project{{ promoted_projects|pluralize:" is,s are" }} looking for more applicants, but {{ promoted_projects|pluralize:"it still has,they still have" }} a regular deadline of {{ current_round.appslate }}:
{% endif %}{% for project in promoted_projects %}{% if forloop.first %}
{% endif %}{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{{ project.get_landing_url }}
{% endfor %}{% if closed_projects %}
Some projects have enough applicants, and they are closed to new applicants. If you are currently working with a mentor of one of these projects, make sure to record your contributions and create your final application before the deadline of {{ current_round.appslate }}:
{% endif %}
{% for project in closed_projects %}{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{{ project.get_landing_url }}
{% endfor %}{% if late_projects %}
All other projects{% else %}All projects currently{% endif %} have a deadline of {{ current_round.appslate }}. You will need to record a contribution and create a final application in order to be eligible to be selected as an intern.

If you are currently working on a contribution with a mentor (even if the contribution is not merged or accepted yet), make sure to record the contribution in the Outreachy website, and submit a final application for your project. You can record your contributions by finding your project listed on the project selection page, and following the link 'record your contributions and create a final application' on that project's detailed listing:
{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'project-selection' %}

If you don't see any links to project details or a link to record a contribution, you either aren't logged in, or you haven't filled out the initial application at:
{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'eligibility' %}

If you have any questions about selecting a project or you are having trouble contacting a mentor who has not closed their project to applicants, please email the Outreachy mentors mailing list at mentors@lists.outreachy.org. If you have questions about the initial application, please email the Outreachy applicant helpers applicant-help@outreachy.org
