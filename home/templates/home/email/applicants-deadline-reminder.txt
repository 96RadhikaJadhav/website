Outreachy internship deadlines

{{ current_round.contributions_close }} at 4pm UTC is the deadline for making contributions and submitting your final application for the {{ current_round.official_name }}. If you haven't started a contribution yet, now is the time to pick a project, get in contact with the project mentor, and start working with them on your project contribution:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'project-selection' %}
{% if closed_projects %}
Some projects have enough applicants, and they are closed to new applicants. If you are currently working with a mentor of one of these projects, make sure to record your contributions and create your final application before the deadline:

{% for project in closed_projects %}{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{{ project.get_landing_url }}
{% endfor %}{% endif %}
You will need to record a contribution and create a final application in order to be eligible to be selected as an intern.

If you are currently working on a contribution with a mentor (even if the contribution is not merged or accepted yet), make sure to record the contribution in the Outreachy website, and submit a final application for your project. You can record your contributions by finding your project listed on the project selection page, and following the link 'record your contributions and create a final application' on that project's detailed listing:
{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'project-selection' %}

If you don't see any links to project details or a link to record a contribution, you probably aren't logged in.

If you have any questions about selecting a project or you are having trouble contacting a mentor who has not closed their project to applicants, please email the Outreachy mentors mailing list at mentors@lists.outreachy.org. If you need to privately contact Outreachy organizers, please email the Outreachy applicant helpers at applicant-help@outreachy.org
