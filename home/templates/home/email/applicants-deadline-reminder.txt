{{ current_round.contributions_close|date:"M d" }} deadline for Outreachy {{ current_round.internstarts|date:"M Y" }} internships

{{ current_round.contributions_close }} at 4pm UTC is the deadline for Outreachy internship final applications. Final applications are only open to applicants with an approved initial application for the {{ current_round.official_name }} round.

Only applicants who record a contribution and create a final application will be eligible to be selected as an intern. We encourage you to create a final application well before the deadline. You can edit your final application until the deadline at {{ current_round.contributions_close }} at 4pm UTC.

Your approval to participate in Outreachy is based on the time commitments you listed in your initial application: {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'eligibility-results' %}

If your time commitments are incorrect (such as if you have a job that is not listed on your initial application), please contact us immediately. If your time commitments change, please contact us immediately to correct your initial application: {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'contact-applicant-help' %}

Recording Contributions
-----------------------

You will need to record your contributions for each project you're applying for. Please record your contributions even if the contribution is not merged or accepted yet.

You can record your contributions by finding your project listed on the project selection page:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'project-selection' %}

Then follow the 'record your contributions and create a final application' link.

If you don't see any links to project details or a link to record a contribution, you probably aren't logged in.

Final Applications
------------------

You will need to create a final application for each project you're applying for. Only applicants that complete a final application for that project will be eligible to be selected as an intern for that project.

You can create a final application by finding your project listed on the project selection page:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'project-selection' %}

Then follow the 'create a final application' link.

You can edit your final application until {{ current_round.contributions_close }} at 4pm UTC. A link to edit your final application is on your dashboard:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'dashboard' %}

Time Commitment Changes
-----------------------

If your time commitments have changed since you filled out the initial application, please email applicant-help@outreachy.org. You can see the time commitments listed on your initial application here:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'eligibility-results' %}

If your initial application is missing your current or future job, your school time commitments, your online classes, or your coding school information, get in touch with us to correct it. If the hours of your time commitments are incorrect, get in touch with us to fix it. Please email applicant-help@outreachy.org.

If you are selected as an intern, you will be required to sign a legal internship agreement which asserts that the details in your initial application are correct. It's very important that your time commitments stated in the initial application are correct.
