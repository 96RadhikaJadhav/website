Subject: Outreachy eligibility question for {{ application.applicant.public_name }}

Hi {{ application.applicant.public_name }},

You recently submitted an eligibility form for the Outreachy internship
program.
{% if application.us_sanctioned_country %}
You indicated you were a citizen, resident, or national of Crimea, Cuba,
Iran, North Korea, or Syria.

In order for Outreachy's parent non-profit, Software Freedom Conservancy,
to retain its 501c3 status, it must abide by U.S. law with respect to
countries under U.S. sanctions. Please answer the following questions:

1. Which of these countries are you a resident, citizen, or national of?

2. What country or countries you will be living in during the Outreachy
   internship?

3. Are you eligible to work 40 hours a week in those countries? If you are
   on a resident or work visa, which visa do you have? Please let us know
   if you are a permanent resident or citizen of the country you're living in.

4. Are you planning on sending any portion of your Outreachy internship
   stipend back to family members or friends living in the listed countries?

{% if application.prefer_not_to_say %}
When asked which gender identities you have, you checked that
you would prefer not to specify your gender. Unfortunately,
we do need this information in order to approve you to apply
for Outreachy internships.

Would you be comfortable supplying this information via email?
I'm also happy to chat via video conference if you feel more
comfortable with that.

{% if application.self_identify != '' %}
You marked that your gender identity is {{ application.self_identify }}.
Could you tell me a bit more about what pronouns you use?
If they're listed on pronouns.is, I would love to add
your gender identity and pronouns to our application system.

Thanks,
Outreachy Organizers
