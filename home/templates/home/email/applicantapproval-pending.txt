Subject: Question on Outreachy initial application for {{ application.applicant.public_name }}

Hi {{ application.applicant.public_name }},

You recently submitted an initial application for the Outreachy internship program.

{% if application.us_sanctioned_country %}On your initial application, you said you were a citizen or national of Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, or Syria.

Unfortunately, Software Freedom Conservancy, Outreachy's fiscal sponsor and chartiable home, is a non-profit based in the United States of America. Conservancy must follow U.S. sanctions regulations and cannot knowingly send money to those countries and regions.

Are you currently living in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, or Syria?

If not, will you be sending any part of the internship payment back to family or friends in those countries or regions?

{% endif %}{% if application.applicantgenderidentity.prefer_not_to_say %}When asked which gender identities you have, you checked that you would prefer not to specify your gender. Unfortunately, we do need this information in order to review your Outreachy initial application.

Would you be comfortable supplying this information via email?

{% endif %}{% if application.applicantgenderidentity.self_identify != '' %}Your initial application was marked as pending because you self-identified your gender identity as {{ application.applicantgenderidentity }}.

I've now approved your initial application. Good luck making contributions with Outreachy mentors!
