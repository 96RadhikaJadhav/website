Subject: Question on Outreachy initial application for {{ application.applicant.public_name }}

Hi {{ application.applicant.public_name }},

You recently submitted an initial application for the Outreachy internship program.

{% if application.us_sanctioned_country %}You indicated you were a citizen, resident, or national of Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, or Syria.

In order for Outreachy's parent non-profit, Software Freedom Conservancy,
to retain its 501c3 status, it must abide by U.S. law with respect to
countries under U.S. sanctions. Please answer the following questions:

1. Which of these countries are you a resident, citizen, or national of?

2. What country or countries you will be living in during the Outreachy
   internship?

3. Are you eligible to work 40 hours a week in those countries? If you are
   on a resident or work visa, which visa do you have? Please let us know
   if you are a permanent resident or citizen of the country you're living in.

4. Are you planning on sending any portion of your Outreachy internship
   stipend back to family members or friends living in the listed countries?

{% endif %}{% if application.applicantgenderidentity.prefer_not_to_say %}When asked which gender identities you have, you checked that you would prefer not to specify your gender. Unfortunately, we do need this information in order to review your Outreachy initial application.

Would you be comfortable supplying this information via email?

{% endif %}{% if application.applicantgenderidentity.self_identify != '' %}Your initial application was marked as pending because you self-identified your gender identity as {{ application.applicantgenderidentity }}.

I've now approved your initial application. Good luck making contributions with Outreachy mentors!
