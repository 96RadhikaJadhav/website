Outreachy week 1: Assignments for mentors & interns

Welcome to the first week of your Outreachy internship! We're happy to support you through this journey.

This is the first of several messages Outreachy organizers will send throughout the internship period. Each message will have a section for interns and a section for mentors. We hope this transparency provides better understanding of expectations and goals for both parties and ultimately creates a successful internship!

We have some goals and assignments for both mentors and interns. Please read the sections below to ensure that the first internship feedback (due on {{ current_round.initialfeedback }}) is successful. Contact us at organizers@outreachy.org anytime with questions or comments.

Internship chats
----------------

Every two weeks during the internship, interns, mentors, coordinators, and Outreachy organizers have a chat on the Outreachy Zulip server. The chat schedule is here:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'docs-internship' %}#chats

The first internship chat will take place on {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_date|date:"D M d, Y" }} {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_date|time:"H:i" }} UTC on {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_url }}

Mentor Goals
------------

Week 1 goals:

 - Set up a weekly real-time conversation to check in. This could take place either in chat, phone, or video chat.
 - Let your mentee know what day and times you'll be available to answer questions
 - Be responsive to questions from your intern
 - Send your intern documentation or other resources to help them learn more about your community and their first tasks (you may need to create it if it doesn't exist)
 - Spend time with your intern explaining community norms (contribution style requirements, where to ask questions, who is working on this part of the project, etc)

Week 1 tips:

 - contact Outreachy organizers organizers@outreachy.org if your intern hasn't been in contact with you about their first tasks by the end of week one
 - if you need any help or advice, you can email the mentors mailing list, or ask on the private mentors stream on the Outreachy Zulip chat
 - you've got this!

Intern Goals
------------

Save the date for an introduction chat and Q&A! We want to let you ask any questions of Outreachy organizers, and give you time to connect to other Outreachy interns. The chat will be text-based, using the Outreachy Zulip chat.

The text chat will take place on {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_date|date:"D M d, Y" }} {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_date|time:"H:i" }} UTC on {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_url }}

Week 1 goals:

 - Get in touch with your mentor
 - Discuss how to approach your first tasks
 - Ask your mentor questions about your project
 - Join your free and open source software community's public community chat channels and introduce yourself
 - Sign up for the Outreachy Zulip chat (you should have received an email invitation)
 - Set up your blog, and link to it on your Outreachy profile: https://outreachy.org/account
 - Write a blog post introducing yourself (see guidelines below)

Week 1 tips:

 - Contact Outreachy organizers organizers@outreachy.org if you can't get a hold of your mentor after 2 days of trying to reach them and/or if your mentor is being unresponsive to questions
 - You've got this!

Week 1 Blog
-----------

During your internship, you're expected to blog every two weeks. Please take a look at our blog guidelines and blogging schedule:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'docs-internship' %}#blog

In your first internship blog post, you should:

1. Introduce yourself.
2. Pick 1-3 core values, and talk about why they are important to you.
3. Tell people what motivated you to apply to Outreachy.

See the blog guidelines linked above for suggested blog post length.

Core Values
===

Core values are important personality traits. Core values motivate you when you make decisions. Here's a list of some core values:

https://jamesclear.com/core-values

For example, if I (Sage Sharp) were to talk about my core values, I would say:

"My core values are curiosity, growth, and compassion.

I value curiosity. I always want to know how something works. I'm also curious about why things are built a particular way.

Once I understand the how and why, I want to optimize and improve it. That's why I value growth. I want to be a better person. I want to help the world be a better place.

I also value compassion. I want to support and understand people. I'm always curious about other people's lived experiences."

Your values may be very different from mine. Maybe you're ambitious, you want to be a leader, and you want to influence others. Or maybe you value security, loyalty, and stability. That's great! You should write about the core values that resonate with you.

Pick 1 to 3 core values. Talk about why they are important to you.
