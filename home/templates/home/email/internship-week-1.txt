Outreachy week 1: Assignments for mentors & interns

Welcome to the first week of your Outreachy internship! We're happy to support you through this journey.

This is the first of several messages Outreachy organizers will send throughout the internship period. Each message will have a section for interns and a section for mentors. We hope this transparency provides better understanding of expectations and goals for both parties and ultimately creates a successful internship!

We have some goals and assignments for both mentors and interns. Please read the sections below to ensure that the first internship feedback (due on {{ current_round.initialfeedback }}) is successful. Contact us at organizers@outreachy.org anytime with questions or comments.

Internship chats
----------------

Every two weeks during the internship, interns, mentors, coordinators, and Outreachy organizers have a chat on the Outreachy Zulip server. The chat schedule is here:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'docs-internship' %}#chats

The first internship chat will take place on {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_date|date:"D M d, Y" }} {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_date|time:"H:i" }} UTC on {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_url }}

Mentor Goals
------------

Week 1 goals:

 - Set up a weekly real-time conversation to check in. This could take place either in chat, phone, or video chat.
 - Let your mentee know what day and times you'll be available to answer questions
 - Be responsive to questions from your intern
 - Send your intern documentation or other resources to help them learn more about your community and their first tasks (you may need to create it if it doesn't exist)
 - Spend time with your intern explaining community norms (contribution style requirements, where to ask questions, who is working on this part of the project, etc)

Week 1 tips:

 - contact Outreachy organizers organizers@outreachy.org if your intern hasn't been in contact with you about their first tasks by the end of week one
 - if you need any help or advice, you can email the mentors mailing list, or ask on the private mentors stream on the Outreachy Zulip chat
 - you've got this!

Intern Goals
------------

Save the date for an introduction chat and Q&A! We want to let you ask any questions of Outreachy organizers, and give you time to connect to other Outreachy interns. The chat will be text-based, using the Outreachy Zulip chat.

The text chat will take place on {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_date|date:"D M d, Y" }} {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_date|time:"H:i" }} UTC on {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_url }}

Week 1 goals:

 - Get in touch with your mentor
 - Discuss how to approach your first tasks
 - Ask your mentor questions about your project
 - Join your free and open source software community's public community chat channels and introduce yourself
 - Sign up for the Outreachy Zulip chat (you should have received an email invitation)
 - Set up your blog, and link to it on your Outreachy profile: https://outreachy.org/account
 - Write a blog post about your experience applying to Outreachy (see guidelines below)

Week 1 tips:

 - You've got this!

Week 1 Blog
-----------

During your internship, you're expected to blog every two weeks. Please take a look at our blog guidelines and blogging schedule:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'docs-internship' %}#blog

The goal of your first internship blog post is to explain to someone who is interested in applying for Outreachy what it's like to apply. Many applicants learn about how to apply to Outreachy by following the tips past interns gave for making the most out of the Outreachy application process. This is your chance to help others get an Outreachy internship!

Here's some prompts that could get you started writing this blog post:

 - What motivated you to apply to Outreachy?
 - What were you excited about when thinking about applying? 
 - What made you passionate about the project you applied to?
 - What was confusing about the Outreachy application process?
 - How did you find information?
 - Who did you ask questions of when you were stuck?
 - How did you mentor help you during the application process? 
 - What would you tell someone who is worried about applying to Outreachy? 

You don't have to include all the prompts above in your blog post. See the blog guidelines linked above for suggested blog post length.

Again, if you have any questions, please contact us!
