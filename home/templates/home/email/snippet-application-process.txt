Application Process
-------------------

The first step for applicants is to fill out an eligibility check:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'eligibility' %}

Details about community projects will only be visible to applicants that have completed an eligibility check and are eligible for Outreachy.

The next step is for applicants to work with mentors on a contribution, AND record those in-progress contributions in the Outreachy website. Eligible applicants will see a 'Record Contributions' button on the community landing page next to each project proposal.

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'community-landing' round_slug=current_round.slug slug=community.slug %}

Once applicants have recorded at least one contribution through the Outreachy, they will be able to start their application on the same page. The button text will change from 'Record Contributions' to 'Update Contibutions and Apply to This Project'.

Application Dashboard
---------------------

Coordinators and mentors can see which applicants have recorded a contribution and made an application on the community application dashboard:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'community-applicants' round_slug=current_round.slug community_slug=community.slug %}

Each project has an applicant details page, which is linked from the community application dashboard. The project applicant details page lists applicant's information, time commitments, recorded contributions, and application text.
