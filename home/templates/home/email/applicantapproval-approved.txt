Your Outreachy initial application is approved

Hi {{ recipient.display_name }},

Welcome to the contribution period of the Outreachy {{ application.application_round.internstarts|date:"F Y" }} internship round! Your initial application for Outreachy has been approved.

The next step is to pick one or two projects, talk to the project mentors, and make a contribution to the project. You make a contribution by completing a project task. A contribution could be something like fixing a bug in the project code or updating the project's documentation.

Only applicants who make a contribution will be eligible to be accepted as an Outreachy intern. We encourage you to start making on your contributions as soon as possible! The contribution period starts on {{ application.application_round.contributions_open }} at 4pm UTC. Contributions and final applications are due on {{ application.application_round.contributions_close }} at 4pm UTC.

It's important for you be in contact with the project mentor during the contribution period. Ask questions about the project description. Introduce yourself on the community chat or forums as an Outreachy applicant. Make sure to reach out to the project mentor if you're stuck for more than a couple hours. Mentors are looking for applicants who are consistently in contact and ask for help when they get stuck.
