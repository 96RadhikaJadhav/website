Complete your Outreachy internship applications

In order to be eligible to be selected as an Outreachy intern, you must:

1. Record at least one in-progress contribution you've made to an Outreachy internship project by the project application deadline.

2. Finish an application for that project before the project application deadline. Each project may have a different application deadline.

{% if upcoming_deadlines %}Upcoming Deadlines
------------------
{% for project in upcoming_deadlines %}
{{ project.project_round.community.name }} project "{{ project.short_title }}"
Application deadline: {% if project.deadline == project.LATE %}{{ current_round.appslate }} 4pm UTC{% if comrade.timezone %} / {% load tz %}{% timezone comrade.timezone %}{{ comrade.get_local_late_application_deadline }}{% endtimezone %} {{ comrade.timezone }}{% endif %}{% else %}{{ current_round.appsclose }} 4pm UTC{% if comrade.timezone %} / {% load tz %}{% timezone comrade.timezone %}{{ comrade.get_local_application_deadline }}{% endtimezone %} {{ comrade.timezone }}{% endif %}{% endif %}
{% if project in comrade.get_projects_applied_to %}Your internship application will be reviewed: {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{{ project.get_contributions_url }}{% else %}You have NOT submitted an application for this project. Create one here: {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{{ project.get_contributions_url }}{% endif %}{% if not forloop.last %}
{% endif %}{% endfor %}

You will be able to edit your application until the project application deadline. After the project application deadline, you are encouraged to continue working on contributions with your project mentor. You will be able to record those contributions (or edit other recorded contributions) up to the date the Outreachy interns for this round are announced on {{ current_round.internannounce }}.

The project application will ask you to fill out a timeline for the internship project. Detailed instructions are included in the pages linked above. If you have trouble with this, or a mentor isn't responsive to your questions about the timeline, do the best you can. You should submit an application by the project deadline, even if you feel the timeline isn't complete or perfect.
