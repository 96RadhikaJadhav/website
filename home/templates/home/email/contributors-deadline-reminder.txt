Complete your Outreachy internship final application

In order to be eligible to be selected as an Outreachy intern, you must:

1. Record at least one in-progress contribution you've made to an Outreachy internship project.

2. Create a final application for that project.

You must create a final application for each project. If you don't create a final application for a project, you aren't eligible to be selected as an intern for that project.

Contributions and final applications are due by {{ current_round.contributions_close }} at 4pm UTC{% if comrade.timezone %} / {{ contribution_deadline }} {{ comrade.timezone }}{% endif %}

We encourage you to submit your final applications early. You will be able to edit it until the final application deadline.

Please let the Outreachy organizers know if your time commitments have changed since you filled out an initial application. See the section below for details.

{% for project in role.projects_contributed_to %}{{ project.project_round.community.name }} project "{{ project.short_title }}"
{% if project in applied_projects %}Your final application will be reviewed: {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{{ project.get_contributions_url }}{% else %}You have NOT submitted a final application for this project. Create one here: {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{{ project.get_contributions_url }}{% endif %}{% if not forloop.last %}

{% endif %}{% endfor %}

Final Application
-----------------

You will be able to edit your final applications until the deadline on {{ current_round.contributions_close }} at 4pm UTC{% if comrade.timezone %} / {{ contribution_deadline }} {{ comrade.timezone }}{% endif %}. We encourage you to submit final applications early, and then make edits to it.

After the final application deadline, you are encouraged (but not required) to continue working on contributions with your project mentor. You will be able to record those contributions (or edit other recorded contributions) up to the date the Outreachy interns for this round are announced on {{ current_round.internannounce }}.

The final application will ask you to fill out a timeline for the internship project. Detailed instructions are included in the pages linked above. If you have trouble with this, or a mentor isn't responsive to your questions about the timeline, do the best you can. You should submit a final application by the final application deadline, even if you feel the timeline isn't complete or perfect.
