Application Dashboard
---------------------

Coordinators and mentors can see which applicants have recorded a contribution and made an application on the community application dashboard:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'community-applicants' round_slug=current_round.slug community_slug=community.slug %}

Each project has an applicant details page, which is linked from the community application dashboard. The project applicant details page lists applicant's information, time commitments, recorded contributions, and application text.
