Internship Agreement
--------------------

You will need to log into the Outreachy site and accept the Outreachy internship agreement by {{ current_round.intern_agreement_deadline }}:

https://www.outreachy.org/dashboard 

This is a legal document that asserts the information you provided on your initial and final application (including your eligibility information, school credits, and work information) is accurate and correct. Please review your time commitment information to ensure it is accurate, and email organizers@outreachy.org if you need to make any corrections. Your initial application, with your stated time commitment information can be viewed here:

https://www.outreachy.org/eligibility-results/

You cannot participate in the internship unless you sign the internship agreement. If you don't plan on participating or signing this document, please let organizers@outreachy.org know as soon as possible.

You will need to review the agreement and provide your full legal name as your electronic signature. You may use a nickname or a shortened name for working with Outreachy mentors, but you must provide your full legal name on the internship agreement. Only Outreachy organizers (Marina, Sage, Karen, Cindy, and Tony) and Software Freedom Conservancy staff (Bradley and Brett) will see your legal name.

Payments and tax information
-----------------------------

Outreachy's fiscal sponsor, Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) will be handling tax information and payment processing. They will contact you through their accounting ticketing system to collect information for sending your payments and any tax-related information.

We ask mentors to notify us if an intern hasn't started their work by {{ current_round.intern_not_started_deadline }}. You will receive the emails to collect payment and tax information sometime after {{ current_round.intern_sfc_initial_payment_notification_deadline }} when we notify SFC that you have started your internships, and before {{ current_round.initial_stipend_payment_deadline }} when Conservancy is scheduled to complete sending your initial payment out.

Please note that the SFC payment and tax email addresses are part of a ticketing queue that is an automated system. Please send any questions to organizers@outreachy.org and we will respond to them or properly route them.

Your payments will be sent on the following schedule, provided you start your internship and your mentor notifies us on time that you are in good standing for mid-point and final evaluation. (See "Stipend" section of your internship agreement for full details on this.)

 * ${{ current_round.initialpayment }} will be sent to you by {{ current_round.initial_stipend_payment_deadline }}
 * ${{ current_round.midpayment }} will be sent to you by {{ current_round.midpoint_stipend_payment_deadline }}
 * ${{ current_round.finalpayment }} will be sent to you by {{ current_round.final_stipend_payment_deadline }}

W-9 and W8-BEN forms
--------------------

Depending on the country you reside in, you will be asked to provide either a W-9 or a W8-BEN form. We cannot pay you until you fill out one of these two forms. You may be dropped from the program if you are asked for a form and you do not provide it within a month.

Travel Allowance
----------------

You have $500 travel allowance available to you for travel relevant to Outreachy. The travel allowance is good for one year from the date your internship starts. Please review the information at https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/TravelAllowance 

You will need to discuss the travel stipend with your mentor to determine which conference or event is most relevant to your internship. You mentor will need to approve the conference or event before you book your travel.

Please note that before you book any flights, you will need to take a screenshot of your flight search using a widely-recognized airfare comparison site, such as Orbitz, Kayak or Hipmunk. You should also double check before booking travel if you will need to seek pre-approval from the Outreachy organizers for the travel. https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/TravelAllowance#preapproval If you don't need pre-approval, and your mentor approves the travel as relevant to your internship, there is no need to email the organizers before your travel.

Intern Blog
-----------

You are required to blog every two weeks about your internship. Blog posts don't need to be perfect, and often times writing a blog post will help you find the solution to what you're working on. Blog posts are often details about what the interns are working on, but can also include things that you find surprising about working in open source, techniques for working efficiently, your feelings about the internship, or even talking about what you find confusing. We find the best blog posts are honest and open.

Your blog is required to have an RSS feed so that it can be added to the Outreachy blog planet. A "planet" or "planetaria" is a page with a list of posts from community blogs. The Outreachy planet includes current and past Outreachy interns: http://www.planeteria.info/outreach/

It's not recommended that you hand-create an RSS feed, as people often get links or syntax wrong. Hosted blogging platforms will create an RSS feed for you. Suggested open source blogging platforms are http://wordpress.com or http://www.dreamwidth.org. Some interns set up a blog on GitHub, but that means they may need to manually add RSS feeds. Do not use Medium as your blogging platform, as your past posts will not be easily accessible for people who aren't a paid subscriber.

Please update your profile https://www.outreachy.org/account/ with a link to both the URL for your blog, and the RSS feed for your blog. For the RSS feed, you can specify either the entire blog feed, or a specific feed you want to be aggregated. Some interns add the RSS feed for their "outreachy" tag on their blog, so they can also blog about personal things without it ending up on the Outreachy planet.

Many of the participating FOSS communities have planets for aggregating contributors' blogs. Please ask the coordinator from your organization about it and get your blog added to it too.

E-mails for coordinators and mentors
------------------------------------

mentors@lists.outreachy.org is a private list for all of the program's coordinators and mentors. It may include past coordinators and mentors.

organizers@outreachy.org is an email shared by the coordinators of the program (Cindy Pallares, Karen Sandler, Tony Sebro, Sage Sharp, and Marina Zhurakhinskaya). Please feel free to e-mail either address if you have any general questions about the program at any time. Please always e-mail the list or the alias, and not one of us individually, and keep the list or the alias on CC in subsequent discussion, to ensure you get a faster response and all of us are in the loop. For the questions specific to your organization, please contact your mentor, the organization's coordinator or a relevant mailing list.

Outreachy communications
------------------------

You will receive an invitiation to a private Outreachy chat server. The chat server includes all accepted interns for this round, Outreachy mentors, coordinators, and organizers. The chat server is meant for you to connect on a person level to other Outreachy participants. You should still also participate in the public communication channels for your project and community.

If you haven't received an email invitation to the Outreachy chat server in a week, please let the Outreachy organizers know.

There are two mailing lists you may want to sign up for.

https://lists.outreachy.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/community

The community mailing list is only for current interns, alumni, and current and past mentors of Outreachy. You can chit-chat on the list, ask for help, talk about conferences, ask for career advice, and more.

https://lists.outreachy.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/opportunities

This list is open to anyone who is eligible for the community list, and it is also open to sponsors of the Outreachy program. People use this list to send job postings, other internships, conference CFPs, or other opportunities.

Twitter
-------

Outreachy has a Twitter account @outreachy https://twitter.com/outreachy

Please add your twitter handle to your Outreachy website account if you'd like us to follow you. https://www.outreachy.org/account/

Please feel free to let us know if you have any questions or concerns any time! Good luck with your internship, and congratulations!
