<h2>Outreachy Supports Diversity in Tech</h2>

<p>Outreachy expressly invites applicants who are women (both cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people to apply. We also expressly invite applications who are residents and nationals of the United States of America of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, Native American/American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. Anyone who faces systematic bias or discrimination in the technology industry of their country is invited to apply.</p>

<h2>Outreachy Eligibility Rules</h2>

<p>Outreachy is open to applicants around the world. You will need to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You are or will be 18 years of age or older by {{ current_round.internstarts }}</li>
	<li>You have not previously participated in an Outreachy, Outreach Program for Women, or Google Summer of Code internship. People who participated as an intern for Google Summer of Code are not eligible for Outreachy. All Google Summer of Code participants are ineligible for Outreachy, including people who did not successfully finish their GSoC internship.</li>
	<li>You are available for a full-time, 40 hours a week internship from {{ current_round.internstarts }} to {{ current_round.internends }}.</li>
	<li>Outreachy is open to both students and people who are not students. However, applicants who are students must meet additional requirements. Please have your class schedule and school calendar on hand when completing the initial application.</li>
	<li>Outreachy internships are full-time 40-hour a week internships. Applicants who have part-time or contracting jobs are welcome to apply, but they must meet additional requirements.
</ul>

<p>The initial application also includes questions about:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your gender identity</li>
	<li>Your race or ethnicity (only for residents and nationals of the United States of America)</li>
</ul>

<p>All accepted interns must sign an {% comment %}<a href="{% url 'generic-intern-contract-export' %}">{% endcomment %}intern agreement{% comment %}</a>{% endcomment %}. This is a legal document that certifies you are eligible to apply for Outreachy, and that all the eligibility information you supply in your application is truthful. All accepted interns will need to fill out either a W8-BEN or a W-9 tax form. It is fraud if you sign these legal documents after supplying incorrect information.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about these forms, please note that Outreachy has experience with people in the middle of a legal name change and transgender people who cannot change their legal name. Only Outreachy organizers and the Software Freedom Conservancy accounting team will see these legal documents. Your mentors will not see your tax form or your signed intern agreement.</p>
