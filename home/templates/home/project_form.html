        <h2>Add Project Skills</h2>
	<p>Outreachy applicants often search for projects that fit the skills they have, or the skills they want to learn.
	However, if mentors aren't specific about what skills applicants need in order to apply versus what skills are optional,
	applicants may decide they "aren't qualified" when they are. Applicants with imposter syndrome will often believe they
	need to be an "expert" in a particular skill in order to apply. Listing skills this way enourages people to apply.</p>
