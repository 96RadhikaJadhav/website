    <h2>Add Project Skills</h2>
    <p>Outreachy applicants often search for projects that fit the skills they have, or the skills they want to learn.
    However, if mentors aren't specific about what skills applicants need in order to apply versus what skills are optional,
    applicants may decide they "aren't qualified" when they are. Applicants with imposter syndrome will often believe they
    need to be an "expert" in a particular skill in order to apply. Listing skills this way enourages people to apply.</p>

    <p>You can fill out the optional fields below. If you need to add more skills than there are fields,
    you should save this internship project proposal and then click 'Edit Project information'.</p>
    {{ inlines.0.as_p }}

    <h2>Add Project Communication Channels</h2>
    <p>Most applicants won't be familiar with using open source communication channels. They may be familiar with a
    communication tool (like a mailing list) but not be aware of common open source communication norms.
    Applicants are especially confused by communication protocols like IRC, which usually require client-side software.
    Adding communication channels in this special section will make it more likely for applicants to be able to contact mentors.</p>

    <p>You can fill out the optional fields below. If you need to add more communication channels than there are fields,
    you should save this internship project proposal and then click 'Edit Project information'.</p>
