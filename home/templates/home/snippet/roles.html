<ul>
	<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> During the application process, Outreachy applicants make contributions to FOSS projects and apply to be an Outreachy intern. We don't use the term "student" for Outreachy applicants, since the program is open to anyone over 18 who meets our eligibility criteria. Please use the gender-neutral <a href="http://pronoun.is/they">"they/them" pronouns</a> for Outreachy participants unless the website lists what pronouns they use. Outreachy is open internationally to cis and trans women, but it is also open to trans men, gender queer folks (who often have varied pronouns), and men of color in the United States.</li>
	<li><strong>Intern:</strong> An accepted applicant works with a mentor for three months during the internship period.</li>
	<li><strong>Mentor:</strong> A mentor defines a project, and works with applicants to help them complete contributions to the project during the application process. The mentor works one-on-one with the selected intern during the internship process. An intern can have one or more mentors, but always has one main mentor that tracks their progress. <a href="/mentor/#mentor">Please read the mentor duties.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Volunteer:</strong> During the application process, volunteers help applicants find the right mentor, answer questions, and help applicants when they get stuck trying to make a contribution. <a href="/mentor/#volunteer">Please read the volunteer duties.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Coordinator:</strong> Each internship project must be associated with a FOSS community participating in Outreachy. That community provides funding for interns, either directly from community funds, or by finding a company or foundation to sponsor interns. Each community has one or more coordinators, who review submitted projects, approve mentors, and generally provide a communication link between the mentors and Outreachy organizers. Some smaller communities have only one coordinator, who is also the only mentor. <a href="/mentor/#coordinator">Please read the coordinator duties.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Outreachy organizers:</strong> There is <a href="/contact/">a small set of organizers</a> who oversee the entire Outreachy program. They communicate with coordinators about funding, onboard new communities, collect payment information for interns, coordinate mid-term and final reviews, answer questions, and promote the program to universities, bootcamps, and tech groups.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please avoid using gender-specific language in your community or project proposals.
