			<h1>Open Projects</h1>

			<p>Mentors for these projects are willing to work with new Outreachy
			applicants. Please note that as the round goes on, mentors may close
			their project to new applicants because they are already working with
			many applicants. Make sure to start your required contribution as soon
			as possible!</p>

			<p>Each project mentor is looking for applicants who have
			different skills. Sometimes a skill is a hard requirement for
			an applicant to have. Other times, a mentor might prefer an
			applicant to have a skill, but they would accept an applicant
			as an intern who didn't have that skill. Some skills are "nice
			to have" meaning it would be great if applicants have this
			skill, but the mentor doesn't have a strong preference.</p>

			<p>Each project will require a different level of experience with a
			particular skill. Experience levels are indicated with numbers:
