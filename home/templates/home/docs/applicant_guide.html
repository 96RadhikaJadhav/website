<h2 id='what-is-outreachy'><a href='#what-is-outreachy'>What is Outreachy?</a></h2>

<p>Outreachy is a paid, remote internship program. Outreachy's goal is to support people from groups underrepresented in tech. We help newcomers to free software and open source make their first contributions.</p>

<p>Outreachy provides internships to work open source. People apply from all around the world. Interns work remotely, and are not required to move. Interns are paid a stipend of $5,500 USD for the three month internship. Interns have a $500 USD travel stipend to attend conferences or events.</p>

<p>Interns work with experienced mentors from open source communities. Outreachy internship projects may include programming, user experience, documentation, illustration, graphical design, or data science. Interns often find employment after their internship with Outreachy sponsors or in jobs that use the skills they learned during their internship.</p>

<h2 id='what-is-free-software'><a href='#what-is-free-software'>What is free software and open source?</a></h2>

<p>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is software that gives the user the freedom to use, copy, study, change, and improve it. We encourage you to <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">read an introduction article about open source software</a>.</p>

<p>Open source projects are built collaboratively. Open source contributors work together publicly. Working publicly creates a fun collaborative community around a project. It allows anyone to make innovative changes that reach many people.</p>

<p>Open source contributors work on a lot of different things! You can contribute by developing software. Or you might want to improve user experience by contributing design work. You can help with documentation, community management, marketing, identifying issues and reporting bugs, helping users, event organization, graphic design, and translations.</p>

<p>Sometimes people work on open source in their spare time. Many contributors are employed by companies and non-profit organizations to work on open source. That includes the companies that are sponsoring Outreachy!  Experience with open source is highly valuable in the professional world. Your contributions to open source provide a public portfolio for you. Employers can see your history of public collaboration, which will give them confidence when making hiring decisions.</p>

{% if previous_round %}
	<p>You may want to brush up on your skills for contributing to free and open source software communities. Each project will use a different set of skills, and some mentors may be willing to teach you skills. Projects and the skills they use change each round. The most common skills used in projects last round were:
	<ul>
		{% for common_skill in previous_round.get_common_skills %}
		{% if common_skill.1 > 2 %}<li>{{ common_skill.0 }} - {{ common_skill.1 }} project{{ common_skill.1|pluralize }}</li>{% endif %}
		{% endfor %}
	</ul>

<p>
Once your initial application is approved, the contribution period will open.
The next step
in the Outreachy application process is to look through the list of
participating communities and internship projects. Pick one
or two projects that look interesting to you.  Then you'll
start working on a contribution for the project.
</p>
<p>
Only applicants that make a contribution to a project
will be accepted as an intern, so it's good to not pick too
many projects to apply to.
We don't recommend applying to more than two projects.
</p>
<p>
Many people apply to communities that are accepting multiple
interns in order to increase their chances of getting accepted.
However, when all the applicants think that way, it means
projects that are only accepting one intern don't get a lot of
applicants. You should pick a project that looks interesting to
you, and will help you improve the skills you want to learn.
</p>
<p>
Many people get overwhelmed with the list of projects and don't
know how to choose a project! Our advice is to pick a project
whose mission resonates with you.
</p>
<p>
Once you've narrowed down you list of projects,
you can decide whether the project is right for you by:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Introduce yourself to the project's mentor and discuss
	the internship tasks or contribution tasks listed in the project details.
	Outreachy mentors are friendly and welcome your questions!
	</li>
	<li>
	Reading the project's documentation
	</li>
	<li>
	Lurking on the project's chat, forum, or IRC
	channel (if your project uses IRC and you've
	never used it before, you can read more <a
	href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/IRC">here</a>)
	</li>
	<li>
	Building any software projects
	and running them to check out its latest capabilities (the
	project website usually has the instructions for doing
	this, but don't hesitate twice to ask the project's
	mentor or people on the project's chat forums for help
	if you encounter any problems)
	</li>
	<li>
	Looking at the open issues or feature requests for the project
	</li>
	<li>
	Looking at the recent changes in the project's repository
	or recent contributions pages.
	</li>
	<li>
	Reading the recent discussion on the project's mailing list or forum.
	</li>
	<li>
	Reading the blogs of the project's mentor and other project contributors.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you've picked a project that looks interesting to you,
proceed to the next application process step, which is to start
your contribution to the project.  You should record your
in-progress contributions by logging them from the Outreachy
community landing pages linked from this page.  Only applicants with
recorded contributions will be eligible to be accepted as
interns.
</p>

<p>
Make your contributions early! Many applicants under-estimate
the time it will take to complete a contribution.
If a mentor with a popular project is working with several
promising applicants, they may close the project to new applicants.
