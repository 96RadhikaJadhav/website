<h1>Feedback on Your Internship</h1>

<p>Outreachy organizers collect feedback from interns three times during the Outreachy internship. Please give yourself at least 5 to 15 minutes to complete this form.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>You will submit one form that gives feedback on all your mentors. When in doubt, give feedback on how your primary mentor provides support.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>Your answers will only be seen by Outreachy organizers and by Software Freedom Conservancy accounting staff. Your mentor will not be able to see if you submit feedback to us. If Outreachy organizers need to discuss your feedback with your mentor, we will draft a response with you before contacting your mentor.</p>

<p>Please be honest about your relationship with your mentor. We want to provide you help and ensure you get the support you need.</p>

<h2>Metrics for Success</h2>

<p>Outreachy organizers view this internship as a fellowship. Mentors should not expect a certain project to be completed by the intern, but rather expect that the intern's work will be adjusted to the level of their ability, their interests, and the project's priorities throughout the internship. Outreachy organizers prefer not to fail people in the program as long as they are working full-time on the project.</p>

<p>The most important metric for success is whether you are putting in a full-time, 40 hours a week effort. If your mentor indicates you aren't putting in a full-time effort, we compare your feedback to your mentor's feedback. We work with your mentor to draft a response to you, and then contact you to work on a plan of action to get you back on track.</p>
