<p>Each community must have a coordinator, who is an interface between Outreachy organizers and mentors. <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/#coordinator">Read about community coordinator duties</a>.</p>

<h3>3. Mentors</h3>

<p>Each community needs to have at least one mentor. The mentor must be willing to volunteer at least 5 hours a week during the internship period, and 5-10 hours per week during the application period. <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/#mentor">Read about mentor duties</a></p>

<h3>4. Projects</h3>

<p>Each mentor defines a project for their intern to work on. Outreachy does not allow applicants to define their own project. <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/mentor-faq/#define-a-project">Read about what makes a good Outreachy project.</a></p>

<p>Projects must be <a href="">licensed as open source</a>. Projects must further free software, and <a href="">not be tied to proprietary software.</a></p>
