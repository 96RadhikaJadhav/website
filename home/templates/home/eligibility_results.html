	<p>We're sorry, but after reviewing your application,
	we have determined that you are not a strong applicant for the Outreachy internship program.
	This may be due to one of several reasons:
	<ul>
		<li>You may not be eligible to be paid as a contractor of a non-profit based in the United States of America. This could be due to being a legal minor (under 18), visa restrictions, U.S. sanctions programs, or U.S. export restrictions.</li>
		<li>You may have already participated in Google Summer of Code or a previous Outreachy round.</li>
		<li>You may not have sufficiently explained why your application is aligned with the Outreachy program goal of supporting people from groups under-represented in the technology industry.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Can I contest this result?</h2>
	<p>
	The Outreachy program put full-time commitment checking place
	in order to ensure that both interns and mentors have a good experience.
	Based on our past experience, interns with full-time commitments,
	especially school time commitments, are less likely to have successful internships.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the December 2014 - March 2015 Outreachy internship round, we had 19
	interns who had classes during the majority of the internship time.
	Two interns failed, two interns had to extend their internship by 2 weeks,
	five interns had to extend their internships by 2 to 5 weeks.
	</p>
	<p>
	Consequently, there was a 37% chance that the organization, mentor, and
	intern will have a poor experience if an applicant who is full-time in
	school is accepted. A poor internship experience typically means that
	the Outreachy mentor chooses not to participate in the program again.
	</p>
	<p>
	Outreachy has had a significant drop in the number of failures and
	internship extensions since we implemented the full-time commitment
	policies.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>The Outreachy organizers are very firm about
		the eligibility rules around time commitment requirements.</strong>
	We cannot accept letters to excuse students from class work or late class enrollment letters.
	We cannot accept manager approval for an employee to work for less than the hours in their employment contract.
	</p>
	<p>
	We hope your time commitments change in the future such that you
	are eligible to apply for Outreachy.

Subject: Outreachy eligibility question for {{ application.applicant.public_name }}

Hi {{ application.applicant.public_name }},

You recently submitted an eligibility form for the Outreachy internship
program.
{% if application.us_sanctioned_country %}
You indicated you were a citizen, resident, or national Crimea, Cuba,
Iran, North Korea, or Syria.

In order for Outreachy's parent non-profit, Software Freedom Conservancy,

countries under U.S. sanctions. Please answer the following questions:

1. Which of these countries are you a citizen or national of?
2. Do you currently live in one of the listed countries?
3. Are you planning on sending any portion of your Outreachy internship
   stipend back to family members or friends living in the listed countries?
{% endif %}
{% if application.prefer_not_to_say %}
When asked which gender identities you have, you checked that
you would prefer not to specify your gender. Unfortunately,
we do need this information in order to approve you to apply
for Outreachy internships.

Would you be comfortable supplying this information via email?
I'm also happy to chat via video conference if you feel more
comfortable with that.

{% if application.self_identify != '' %}
You marked that your gender identity is {{ application.self_identify }}.
Could you tell me a bit more about what pronouns you use?
If they're listed on pronouns.is, I would love to add
your gender identity and pronouns to our eligibility checking form.
