	We're sorry, but based on the time commitment information your supplied on your application,
	you don't have 7 consecutive weeks free from full-time commitments.
	</p>

	Outreachy has had applicants who have failed the program in the past due to
	full-time commitments, so the Outreachy organizers are very firm about
	the eligibility rules around time commitment requirements.
	We cannot accept letters to excuse students from class work or late class enrollment letters.
	We cannot accept manager approval for an employee to work for less than the hours in their employment contract.
	</p>

	We hope your time commitments change in the future such that you
	are eligible to apply for Outreachy.

Bcc: Outreachy Organizers &ltorganizers@outreachy.org&gt
Subject: Outreachy eligibility question for {{ application.applicant.public_name }}

Hi {{ application.applicant.public_name }},

You recently submitted an eligibility form for the Outreachy internship
program.
{% if application.us_sanctioned_country %}
You indicated you were a citizen, resident, or national Crimea, Cuba,
Iran, North Korea, or Syria.

In order for Outreachy's parent non-profit, Software Freedom Conservancy,
to retain its 503c6 status, it must abide by U.S. law with respect to
countries under U.S. sanctions. Please answer the following questions:

1. Which of these countries are you a citizen or national of?
2. Do you currently live in one of the listed countries?
3. Are you planning on sending any portion of your Outreachy internship
   stipend back to family members or friends living in the listed countries?
{% endif %}
{% if application.prefer_not_to_say %}
When asked which gender identities you have, you checked that
you would prefer not to specify your gender. Unfortunately,
we do need this information in order to approve you to apply
for Outreachy internships.

Would you be comfortable supplying this information via email?
I'm also happy to chat via video conference if you feel more
comfortable with that.

{% endif %}
{% if application.self_identify != '' %}
You marked that your gender identity is {{ application.self_identify }}.
Could you tell me a bit more about what pronouns you use?
If they're listed on pronouns.is, I would love to add
your gender identity and pronouns to our application system.

Thanks,
Outreachy Organizers
