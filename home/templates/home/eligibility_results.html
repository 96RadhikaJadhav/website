	Only applicants that make a contribution will be accepted as an intern.
	Some projects will have instructions for how to make your first contributions.

	<h1>Initial application is not approved</h1>
	<p>We're sorry, but after reviewing your application,
	we have determined that you are not a strong applicant for the Outreachy internship program.
	This may be due to one of several reasons:
	<ul>
		<li>You may not be eligible to be paid as a contractor of a non-profit based in the United States of America. This could be due to you not being eligible to work in all the countries you are living in during your internship, you being a legal minor (under 18), visa restrictions, U.S. sanctions programs, or U.S. export restrictions.</li>
		<li>You may have already participated in Google Summer of Code or a previous Outreachy round.</li>
		<li>You may not have sufficiently explained why your application is aligned with the Outreachy program goal of supporting people from groups under-represented in the technology industry.</li>
	</ul>
	Please review your application below to ensure the information you submitted is correct.

	If the information is incorrect, please <a href="/contact">contact the Outreachy organizers</a> to update it.

	<p>
	We're sorry, but based on the time commitment information your supplied on your initial application,
	you don't have 7 consecutive weeks free from full-time commitments.

	<p>
	We encourage you to apply another round.
	Please sign up for the

		<strong>{{ free_period_start_date|date:"F d, Y" }} to {{ free_period_end_date|date:"F d, Y" }}</strong>.</p>
		<p>Outreachy interns must have a minimum number of 49 consecutive days free from full-time commitments
		from {{ current_round.internstarts|date:"F d, Y" }} to {{ current_round.internends|date:"F d, Y" }}.
		</p>
		<p>You have {{ longest_period_free }} consecutive days free from full-time commitments.
		We cannot lower the minimum number of days for any applicant.</p>
	{% else %}
		<p>Based on the information you provided, you have no

		<strong>{{ current_round.internstarts|date:"F d, Y" }} to {{ current_round.internends|date:"F d, Y" }}</strong>.</p>

	{% endif %}

	<h2>Can I contest this result?</h2>
	<p>
	The Outreachy program put full-time commitment checking place
	in order to ensure that both interns and mentors have a good experience.
	Based on our past experience, interns with full-time commitments,
	especially school time commitments, are less likely to have successful internships.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the December 2014 - March 2015 Outreachy internship round, we had 19
	interns who had classes during the majority of the internship time.
	Two interns failed, two interns had to extend their internship by 2 weeks,
	five interns had to extend their internships by 2 to 5 weeks.
	</p>
	<p>
	Consequently, there was a 37% chance that the organization, mentor, and
	intern will have a poor experience if an applicant who is full-time in
	school is accepted. A poor internship experience typically means that
	the Outreachy mentor chooses not to participate in the program again.
	</p>
	<p>
	Outreachy has had a significant drop in the number of failures and
	internship extensions since we implemented the full-time commitment
	policies.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>The Outreachy organizers are very firm about
		the eligibility rules around time commitment requirements.</strong>
	We cannot accept letters to excuse students from class work or late class enrollment letters.
	We cannot accept manager approval for an employee to work for less than the hours in their employment contract.
	</p>
	<p>
	We hope your time commitments change in the future such that you
	are eligible to apply for Outreachy.
