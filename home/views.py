# Call for communities, mentors, and volunteers page

# This is complex, so class-based views don't help us here.
#
# We want to display four sections:
#  * Blurb about what Outreachy is
#  * Timeline for the round
#  * Communities that are participating and are open to mentors and volunteers
#  * Communities that have participated and need to be claimed by coordinators
#
# We need to end up with:
#  * The most current round (by round number)
#  * The communities participating in the current round (which have their CFP open)
#  * The communities which aren't participating in the current round
#
# We need to do some database calls in order to get this info:
#  * Grab all the rounds, sort by round number (descending), hand us back one round
#  * For the current round, grab all Participations (communities participating)
#  * Grab all the communities
#
# To get the communities which aren't participating:
#  * Make a set of the community IDs from the communities
#    participating in the current round (participating IDs)
#  * Walk through all communities, seeing if the community ID is
#    in participating IDs.
#    * If so, put it in a participating communities set
#    * If not, put it in a not participating communities set
