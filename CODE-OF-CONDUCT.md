# Outreachy Community Code of Conduct
  
## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as Outreachy applicants, interns, alumni, mentors, coordinators, organizers, and other contributors (collectively known as Outreachy community members) pledge to make participation in Outreachy and the Outreachy community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by Outreachy community members include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks * Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Providing false information on the Outreachy mentor or intern agreement, the internship application, W-9 form, third-party payment authorization, or payment authorization request

## Our Responsibilities

Outreachy organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Outreachy organizers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

Outreachy organizers have the right to ban temporarily or permanently any Outreachy community member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Examples of bans include but are not limited to:

* A temporary or permanent ban from an Outreachy project space
* A temporary or permanent ban from applying for an Outreachy internship
* A temporary or permanent ban from participating as an Outreachy mentor, coordinator, organizer, alumni, or contributor
* Removal of an Outreachy intern from the program, severance of their Outreachy internship agreement, and no disbursement of any remaining internship stipends or travel stipends

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within Outreachy project spaces:

* [The Outreachy website](https://www.outreachy.org)
* The Outreachy public and private mailing lists
* The Outreachy IRC channels, including private channels and public channels:
  * [irc://irc.gnome.org/outreachy](irc://irc.gnome.org/outreachy)
  * [irc://irc.gnome.org/outreachy-admins](irc://irc.gnome.org/outreachy-admins)
* The Outreachy public and private git repositories:
  * [https://github.com/sagesharp/outreachy-django-wagtail/](https://github.com/sagesharp/outreachy-django-wagtail/)
  * [https://github.com/sagesharp/outreachy](https://github.com/sagesharp/outreachy)
  * [https://gitlab.com/sagesharp/outreachy-notes](https://gitlab.com/sagesharp/outreachy-notes)
* Any additional Outreachy project spaces added in the future

When Outreachy community members make contributions and participate in public discussion during the application period and the internship period, they represent the Outreachy project and its reputation. Therefore, this Code of Conduct applies to:

* Public communication between Outreachy community members during the application period or internship period in community spaces of free software projects or non-profits who are participating as Outreachy mentoring communities
* Public Outreachy intern blog posts and comments by Outreachy community members on those blog posts
* Private communication between Outreachy community members related to an Outreachy application or internship

This Code of Conduct also applies to official Outreachy communication, such as:

* Using an official outreachy.org e-mail address
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event, including all cases when you have Outreachy travel funding allocated for that event
* Posting via an official Outreachy social media account:
  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/outreachy)
  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18204091/)

Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by the Outreachy organizers.

If a concern about a past incident in any space is brought up about a current Outreachy community member, Outreachy organizers may take it into account when deciding whether the incident should have any consequences to the community member's participation in the Outreachy community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Outreachy organizers through our [website contact form](https://www.outreachy.org/contact/).

The contact form reaches the five Outreachy organizers, who can be emailed
individually with an incident report:

* Sage Sharp <sage@outreachy.org>
* Marina Zhurakhinskaya <marinaz@outreachy.org>
* Karen Sandler <karen@outreachy.org>
* Tony Sebro <tony@outreachy.org>
* Cindy Pallares-Quezada <cindy@outreachy.org>

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The Outreachy organizers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
