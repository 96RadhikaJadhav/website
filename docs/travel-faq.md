# Hotel FAQs

Q1. The conference is taking place at a particular hotel. Do I have to stay there or can I pick a different hotel?

Q1. You're not obligated to stay in a particular hotel. You must pick a hotel that costs less than the nightly guidelines for the city. See the "Rates" section on the [Conservancy travel policy](https://sfconservancy.org/projects/policies/conservancy-travel-policy.html)

However, sometimes it does make sense to stay in the conference hotel. People often get together for dinner after the conference. It can be hard when you have to travel a long way back to your hotel after dinner. Please keep your safety in mind when picking lower cost hotel options.

Q2. Do I have to stay in a hotel or can I use AirBnB?

Q2. Yes, you can use AirBnB.

Q3. Can I stay in a hotel room with a friend and split travel costs?

Q3. Yes, it's fine to stay with a friend and split hotel costs. You'll ask for reimbursement for your portion of the hotel costs.

Q4. Can I stay longer before or after the conference?

Q4.  From the [Conservatory travel policy](https://sfconservancy.org/projects/policies/conservancy-travel-policy.html): "Conservancy only reimburses for room charges (plus relevant taxes and fees) for the necessary travel dates." If a conference starts the morning of a particular day and you're flying in, Conservancy will reimburse hotel for the night before the conference. They'll also reimburse for hotel the night of when the conference ends. If you want to stay longer, that's fine, but you can't ask for reimbursement for hotel costs for those extra nights.

# Flight FAQ

Q1. What is the maximum amount I can pay for a flight?

Q1. We can't reimburse more than your $500 USD travel stipend. Conservancy will only pay for the amount of the low-cost flight, plus $100 USD. When you do a search for a flight using a comparison flight search engine, there will be one flight which is the lowest cost option. Often that involves long delays, multiple stops, etc. That flight is at a particular price. You can claim reimbursement for your flight costs for up to that price, plus $100. Basically, you don't have to fly using the cheapest airfare, but you can't ask for a reimbursement for over $100 more than that cheapest airfare. Be sure to save your screenshot of that airfare search to send to Conservancy when you want reimbursement of your flight.

Q2. The conference is in a particular city, but I want to take a vacation in a nearby city. What if I'm flying into and out of a different city? Or flying on different dates? Or flying into three or more cities instead of using round-trip airfare?

Q2. Do a flight comparison search for a round-trip flight to the city the conference or event is in, for the dates that make sense for the conference. The lowest cost option, plus $100 USD, is how much you can ask for reimbursement on the flight you purchased. If your flight cost more than $100 USD over the low cost option, you will need to cover that expense yourself. Be sure to save your screenshot of that airfare search to send to Conservancy when you want reimbursement of your flight.
