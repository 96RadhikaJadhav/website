Background
---

Outreachy applicants have trouble parsing and understanding our very
complex eligibility rules. We need an automated system that checks their
answers and tells them whether they are eligible.

In this design document, the question format is posed as:

Number. Question
        D: Data format (e.g. check many, check one, integer, date,
           character field, URL)

Questions to Ask Applicants
---------------------------

At the top of every page, display a reassuring message:

Student eligibility is a complex algorithm:


If (#20 - #15) >= 7 weeks exactly, they are eligible. Otherwise it gets much
more complex:


calculate number of full-time weeks free
----------------------------------------

if enrolled in current term (#17 != 0):
	full-time start date = #15
else:
	full-time start date = internship start date

if enrolled in next term (#23 != 0):
	full-time end date = #20
else:
	full-time end date = internship end date

full-time days free between terms = (full-time end date - full-time start date)



calculate number of eligible half-time weeks free
-------------------------------------------------


if enrolled in current term (#17 != 0) AND
	the number of credits they're enrolled for (#17)
	minus the number of credits used as internship credits (#18)
        minus the number of thesis or research credits (#19)
        is less than or equal to half of the typical credits (#16 / 2)
	then count those weeks as eligible part-time weeks.

	if ((#17 != 0) and (#17 - #18 - #19) <= (#16 / 2))
		part-time days for current term = (#15 - internship start date)
	else
		part-time days for current term = 0

full-time days free between terms = (full-time end date - full-time start date)

if enrolled in next term (#23 != 0) AND
	the number of credits they're enrolled for (#23)
	minus the number of credits used as internship credits (#24)
        minus the number of thesis or research credits (#25)
        is less than or equal to half of the typical credits (#22 / 2)
	then count those weeks as eligible part-time weeks.

	if ((#23 != 0) and (#23 - #24 - #25) <= round_down(#22 / 2))
		part-time days for next term = (internship end date - #20)
	else
		part-time days for next term = 0

if (full-time days free + part-time days free) >= 7*7:
	eligible!
else
	not eligible :(

If not eligible, display the following information:

 - We define an academic term as starting the first day of classes for ALL
   students up to the last day in the exam period for ALL students. We cannot
   accept letters of exception for skipping classes, even if that is part of
   the standard university process for students with internships. We cannot
   accept proof of late enrollment in classes.
